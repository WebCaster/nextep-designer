buildHelp=This section allows you to configure your delivery. You can (re)compute the build set automatically based on the version information. Then you can fine-tune your delivery by adding/removing items manually. Once you have finished, you can generate the resulting build script in your module.
buildDependencyHelp=This section allows you to define the dependencies of this delivery module. Dependencies represent modules releases which needs to be installed in order for this module to work properly. Pick any module release and transfer it to the "dependent module" table to create a dependency.
