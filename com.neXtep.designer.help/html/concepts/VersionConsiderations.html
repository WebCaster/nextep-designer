<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">neXtep Designer gives
you the control over the lifecycle of your database developments. But
you are still responsible of how you want to manage this lifecycle
depending on your organization. Here, we will browse a few common
use-cases and suggest you different ways of managing your
developments' versions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The following is only
suggestions of &ldquo;best-practices&rdquo; to allow you to

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Every
version belongs to a branch. When you start to work with designer,
you will work on the initial MAIN branch (also called the &ldquo;root&rdquo;
versioning branch). You can see branches as isolation of the
lifecycle of your application on a given environment. Therefore, as
long as you only have one release to maintain, you will be fine with
the initial MAIN branch.</FONT></P>

you start your project from scratch, you will start to develop on the

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A few weeks after your
delivery, the test team get back to you with a major bug which
prevent them from testing the entire application. Problem is : your
next delivery is in one week and your current developments cannot be
delivered yet. You need to deliver an urgent patch of your previous
delivery.</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In order to patch the
previously delivered release, the best way would be to create a
parallel release of your delivered module in a dedicated branch. You
will first need to create a new versioning view of the delivered
0.0.1.1 release on which you will make the patch. You will then
commit your changes on a branch called &ldquo;INTEG&rdquo; (short for
integration environment) which means the branch is dedicated to the
integration deliveries.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><IMG SRC="VersioningSingle2.png" NAME="images1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=237 HEIGHT=321 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You can then safely
continue your work and will be able to patch your previously
delivered developments, should you need to. But the most important
thing is to integrate the patch you sent to the integration team into
your current developments, without developing the same patch twice.
With this way of doing things, you will be able to <B>merge</B> the
&ldquo;patch&rdquo; release (0.0.2.1) with your current developments.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><IMG SRC="VersioningSingle3.png" NAME="images3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=274 HEIGHT=475 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">After having merged
your patch with your current developments (release 0.0.4.0), you can
go on with your developments (0.0.5.0). The way of managing your
release is especially important when working with databases because
your deliveries are incremental : one applies on another and
&ldquo;migrates&rdquo; a given release to another one. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Now we consider that
you have finished with your current developments and you want to
deliver it to the integration team. You will be able to build a
delivery for the integration platform by merging your developments
back to the INTEG branch which now represents the integration
&ldquo;delivery&rdquo; flow. Differencies between the previous
release from this branch and your new release will make your new
delivery delta, as shown in the following diagram :</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><IMG SRC="VersioningSingle4.png" NAME="images4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=346 HEIGHT=526 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We have seen the main
process which is extensible indefinitely. When your developments are
deployed on a production platform, you will need a production branch
thus allowing you to deliver patch for this platform. Any of this
patches will be merged to your development branch and integration
branch and so on.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is the main
concept to understand. All other considerations are an extension of
this root concept.
