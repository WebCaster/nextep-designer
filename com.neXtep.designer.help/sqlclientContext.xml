   <context id="SQLResultsView" title="The SQL results view">
      <description>This view shows the results of a SQL query in a structured table. 

You can simply read your data or perform more complex operations, such as sorting the results, switching to edit mode to modify your data, add or remove rows, etc.

Note that you can only edit the data when the SQL query selected only 1 table and at least all primary key columns (or all columns for table without any PK defined).

By default, the view is dedicated to a connection. If you re-issue a query from the same source (SQL client or SQL editor), it will fall in the same view instance unless you &quot;pin&quot; it.</description>

   <context id="SQLClient" title="The SQL client">
      <description>The SQL client allows you to query a database by issuing any supported SQL statement. Any SQL statement can be executed : select, update, insert, delete, alter, create, drop, etc.

By default, the editor is opened on a connection and initializes a new transaction. That means that any data modification you do will be visible to others only after committing. You can switch to auto-commit mode through the client&apos;s toolbar. 

Any SQL statement which returns a result will have its results displayed in an external SQL results view.</description>
