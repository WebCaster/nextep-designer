				<text id="why-should-i-download-description" style-id="page-description">
					&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We need you to upgrade manually to this
					release (&lt;i&gt;this time only&lt;/i&gt;) by downloading the full archive from our
					servers as neXtep Designer has been fully repackaged to integrate a
					new way of delivering updates through P2 (the eclipse provisioning
					platform).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
					Unfortunately, the provisioning
					framework (P2) is not compatible with already installed products
					(which do not contain initial P2 metadata information) and could
					therefore not be upgraded automatically.

				<text id="what-will-happen-description" style-id="page-description">
					&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will not be able to update your product
					anymore because no more update will be published to the old 1.0.3
					branch.

				label="&#8226;&#160;How do I update my neXtep Designer installation with 1.0.4?">
				<text id="how-do-i-update-description" style-id="page-description">
					&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Same as before, through the menu &lt;i&gt;Software >
					check for neXtep updates&lt;/i&gt;. The new mechanism is completely
					transparent and your product will be automatically updated when
					updates are available. Users who subscribed neXtep support need to
					enter their license key by going in the menu &lt;i&gt;Software > Edit
					license information&lt;/i&gt;. This has to be done only once per site since
					the license key will be shared with all users of a same neXtep
					repository.

				<text id="will-i-need-reinstall-description" style-id="page-description">
					&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, we hope no. But since we are relying on
					the eclipse framework, we cannot guarantee that this will not
					happen again. Eclipse releases one major release per year and these
					releases &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; require full install. For information, we have been
					able to provide 2 major eclipse upgrades transparently (3.3 to 3.4
					and 3.4 to 3.5) in the past 3 years...
